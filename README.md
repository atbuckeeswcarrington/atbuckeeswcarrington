Hello, im carrington or noah, but im mostly known as wens / el / sam. This is my alt account for @wednesdayaddamsss , but this is basically my other-ish identity(?).

 I'm a huge fan of belfort and lupin -- aswell as other fandoms like sam & colby, 2000 disney show, and jake & johnnie + tara.

⤷ .ᐟ.ᐟ.ᐟ you will mostly see me with this github if I have a certain 2 ponies on, other than that it is not likely I will use this github for other ponies. (pos. update in the future?)

c+h is always accepted unless my user says dni. Also I might be getting supporter so yay I can sleep on ponytown like an idiot!!! ^_<ㅤ
